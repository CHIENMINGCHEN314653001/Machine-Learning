Although both Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression result in a linear decision boundary expressed in a sigmoid form, their underlying principles and assumptions differ significantly.

Explain the conceptual and statistical differences between GDA and Logistic Regression.  
In particular, discuss their modeling assumptions, how each method approaches the classification problem, and under what data conditions one method might be more appropriate or perform better than the other.
