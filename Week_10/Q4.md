**Although both Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression result in a linear decision boundary expressed in a sigmoid form, their underlying principles and assumptions differ significantly.**

**Explain the conceptual and statistical differences between GDA and Logistic Regression.  
In particular, discuss their modeling assumptions, how each method approaches the classification problem, and under what data conditions one method might be more appropriate or perform better than the other.**
<br></br>
**Result:**

GDA is suitable for situations where the data distribution is close to Gaussian and the sample size is limited, while Logistic Regression performs better with non-Gaussian features and large datasets that are more common in the real world. Although both can form a linear boundary, GDA is derived from "modeling the data distribution", while LR directly finds the posterior model that best distinguishes the classes. The two have significant differences in concept, assumptions and use cases.
