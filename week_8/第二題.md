### What is Stochastic Differential Equation(SDE)?

**Definition: Stochastic Differential Equation(SDE)**


It is a type of differential equation that models the evolution of a stochastic process over time while incorporating randomness or noise. 
An SDE typically takes the form of an Itô process:

$$
dx_t = f(x_t, t)dt + g(x_t, t)dW_t
$$

| Component | Term | Role |
| :---:| :---: | :---: |
| $$dx_t$$ | Change in the process | The infinitesimal change in the variable $$x$$ over time $$t.$$ |
| $$f(x_t, t)dt$$ | Drift  | Represents the deterministic or expected change in $$x_t$$ , similar to the velocity in an ODE. |
| $$g(x_t, t)\,dW_t$$ |Diffusion | Represents the stochastic or random fluctuations. This term introduces uncertainty. |
| $$W_t$$ | Wiener Process | Also known as Brownian Motion, this is the primary source of randomness. Its increments $$dW_t$$ are independent and normally distributed with variance proportional to $$dt$$. |



**Itô Calculus**

The inclusion of the Wiener process $$\left(dW_t\right)$$ is what distinguishes SDEs from ODEs. Because the change $$dW_t$$ is proportional to $\sqrt{dt}$ (rather than $dt$), SDEs require a special the Itô calculus for correct integration and manipulation.
In machine learning, SDEs provide a unified, continuous-time framework for generating complex data distributions by controlling the interplay between drift and diffusion.

**Numerical Solutions for Stochastic Differential Equations**

The most common and foundational SDE numerical solver is the Euler-Maruyama Method, while the Milstein Method offers higher accuracy.

**Euler-Maruyama Method (EM)**

The Euler-Maruyama method is the simplest and most frequently used SDE numerical integrator. It is based on discretizing the SDE definition 

$$dx_t = f(x_t, t)dt + g(x_t, t)dW_t.$$

Given the SDE $dx_t = f(x_t, t)dt + g(x_t, t)dW_t$ and a fixed time step $$\Delta t:$$

$$x_{i+1} = x_i + f(x_i, t_i)\Delta t + g(x_i, t_i)\Delta W_i$$

Where:

* $x_i$ is the approximation at time $t_i$.
* $\Delta t = t_{i+1} - t_i$ is the time step size.
* $\Delta W_i$ is the increment of the Wiener process, which is an independent random variable sampled from a normal distribution:

$$\Delta W_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Delta t)$$

$$\quad$$ $$\quad$$ In code implementation, this is often written as $\Delta W_i = Z_i \sqrt{\Delta t}$, where $Z_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.

**Numerical Accuracy**

* Weak Order: $$1.0.$$ $$\quad$$ This measures how close the statistical moments of the numerical solution are to the true solution.
* Strong Order: $$0.5.$$ $$\quad$$ This measures how close a single trajectory of the numerical solution is to the true solution's trajectory.

**Milstein Method**

It adds a correction term, based on the derivative of $g(x_t, t)$ with respect to $x$, to the Euler-Maruyama term.

$$x_{i+1} = x_i + f(x_i, t_i)\Delta t + g(x_i, t_i)\Delta W_i + \frac{1}{2} g(x_i, t_i) \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x_i, t_i) \left( (\Delta W_i)^2 - \Delta t \right)$$

Where $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$$ is the Jacobian or gradient of $$g$$ with respect to $$x.$$


* Strong Order: $$1.0.$$

Because the Milstein method requires computing the complex term $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$$ , it is typically only used when $$g(x_t, t)$$ is simple or when extremely high accuracy is required. In many high-dimensional applications like machine learning, the Euler-Maruyama method is often preferred due to its simplicity and computational efficiency.
