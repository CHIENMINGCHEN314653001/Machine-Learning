Consider a Generalized Linear Model  where the response variable $$y$$ follows a Bernoulli Distribution

with 

$$μ=E[y∣x]=P(y=1∣x)$$

Hypothesis (Non-Canonical Choice): We employ the Identity Link Function, such that the natural parameter η is set equal to the mean $$μ$$:

$$η=μ$$

The core GLM assumption remains:

$$η=θ^Tx$$

$$Q$$. Does the mathematical definition of the GLM break down when using a non-canonical identity link (η=μ) for the Bernoulli distribution?
