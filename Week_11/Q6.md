Consider a Generalized Linear Model  where the response variable $$y$$ follows a Bernoulli Distribution

with 

$$μ=E[y∣x]=P(y=1∣x)$$

Hypothesis (Non-Canonical Choice): We employ the Identity Link Function, such that the natural parameter η is set equal to the mean $$μ$$:

$$η=μ$$

The core GLM assumption remains:

$$η=θ^Tx$$

$$Q$$. Does the mathematical definition of the GLM break down when using a non-canonical identity link (η=μ) for the Bernoulli distribution?

**Result**

Using an identity link for a Bernoulli GLM does not violate the formal GLM framework. GLMs allow any invertible, differentiable link function. So the identity link is allowed mathematically.

However, the model becomes incoherent because the identity link does not respect the Bernoulli mean constraints. The Bernoulli mean μ must lie strictly between 0 and 1. But under the identity link, μ equals θᵀx, which can take any real value depending on x. As a result, the predicted mean can fall outside the valid interval [0, 1], making the likelihood undefined or impossible to maximize. The Fisher scoring/IRLS updates also become unstable, and the model may not converge.

So while the GLM equations themselves do not fail, the statistical model ceases to make sense because the link does not ensure that μ stays in the admissible range. That is why the canonical logit link is used: it maps all real numbers into (0, 1), preserving the constraints of the Bernoulli distribution.

So the GLM formula still holds, but the identity link destroys the viability of the Bernoulli model, so the approach is mathematically allowed but practically invalid.
