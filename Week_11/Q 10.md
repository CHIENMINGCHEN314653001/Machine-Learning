**If the PDE $$\mathcal{L}[u]=f$$ involves higher-order differentials (e.g., fourth-order Biharmonic equations), what potential numerical computational problems might be encountered when training the network using the standard PINN loss function?**

When a PDE involves higher-order derivatives such as the fourth-order Biharmonic operator, training a PINN becomes much more difficult because the network must compute third- and fourth-order derivatives through automatic differentiation. These derivatives amplify numerical errors, leading to exploding or vanishing gradients and creating a stiff, highly anisotropic loss landscape that slows optimization and makes convergence unstable.

Common activation functions also struggle in this setting: ReLU cannot represent higher-order derivatives, while smoother functions like tanh or swish produce unstable or noisy high-order gradients. The repeated differentiation required for high-order PDEs further accumulates floating-point errors, causing noisy PDE residuals and degrading training stability.

Moreover, high-order PDEs introduce stronger global coupling across the domain, making the solution highly sensitive to collocation point placement. As a result, significantly more collocation points are needed, increasing computational cost.

These numerical difficulties are well-known in the PINN literature and are not considered an open research problem, though ongoing work aims to mitigate them.
