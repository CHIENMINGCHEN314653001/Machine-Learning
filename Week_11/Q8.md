**Why does the simulation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process at time $T$ show a single distribution, even though the process starts from multiple different initial values?**
<br></br>
**Result:**

This phenomenon is a core property of a large class of stochastic processes called Ergodic Processes (or processes that possess a unique stationary distribution). The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is the canonical example of a linear SDE with this property.
