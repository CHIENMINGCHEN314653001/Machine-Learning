* Given a smooth activation function $$𝜎$$ , to what extent can a finite-layer neural network approximate the function $$𝑥^𝑝?$$
* If a neural network can approximate $$𝑥^𝑝$$ using finite difference methods, can this approximation affect the statistical estimation error of the model parameters $$𝜃?$$

<br></br>
**Result**

* **Problem1:**
For any power 𝑝, and over any finite interval $$[-M, M]$$, there exists a neural network with a finite number of layers (or even just one hidden layer) but wide enough, whose output, using a smooth activation function, has an error less than any positive number that we predetermine.

* **Problem2:**
Using the finite difference method to construct neural networks will definitely affect the statistical estimation error of model parameters, but whether this effect is good or bad is not a universally applicable conclusion. It depends on:
<br></br>
  * Problem-relevance: How well does this numerical method match the real-world problem you are trying to solve?
  * Implementation details: How do you integrate the finite difference method into the network architecture?
  * Data quality and quantity: How much data do you have? What is the noise level of the data?
<br></br>
Therefore, this is a open problem, and current research is exploring how to effectively integrate prior knowledge of
numerical analysis into deep learning to achieve better statistical efficiency.
